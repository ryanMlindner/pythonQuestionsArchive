#What is this?

This repository is a place for keeping track of all the raw code I do in answer to interview
questions I find online. The files are named by question + date, and are all taken out of
the online environments in which they run in, so lack input variables in most cases. Thank you 
for checking out my code blurbs! See also https://github.com/ryanMlindner/Recursion-Idle for
a more developed codebase.
